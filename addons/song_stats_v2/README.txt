This addon shows a popup with the song details and album cover
This version is tailored for twitch.tv/wr4thtv

Just add current_song.html into OBS as a browser source
The display will fade in once a song starts, and will fade out when the song ends

If you'd like to preview it, edit script.js and change preview to true at the top of the file
Just remember to change it back to false before using!
And; don't forget to refresh the browser source ;)

NOTE: You will need to enable addons in config/addons.json
